Uses MVC structuring alongside mysql and sequelize to run the database. Node.JS and express.JS are used to create a REST compliant API.
The layout of the application was handled via templates ran with handlebars.js.
Uses GET and POST routes to show and update user forum content.
We use a log in requirement for the POST route and thus employ use of sessions and cookies.
API/libraries used include slugify to modify the user URL for better user experience and bootstrap as styling.
